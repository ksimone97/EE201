# About Me
## My name is Kiana Peterson\!
I am currently an ECE major (I think we all are, though) going down the embedded pathway. This is my second quarter back after 2 years off from school. While it was nice to not worry about assignments, I seem to miss the intellectual abuse that academia gracefully provides :sweat_smile:

## A Few ==Fun Facts==
- I almost died trying to surf in Hawaii :skull:
- I got a tattoo in Jamaica and it got infected (long story) :joy:
- I have a 2 year old :girl:
- I have 9 tattoos
- I get asked how I do anything with my nails at least once/day :nail_care:
